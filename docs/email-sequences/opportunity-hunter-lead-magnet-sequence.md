## WEEK 1: Welcome & Quick Wins (Daily)

### Email 1: Welcome + First Search Challenge
**Subject:** Your Opportunity Hunter access is ready - here's your first mission
**Send:** Immediately after signup

Hi {{first_name}},

Welcome to Opportunity Hunter - you just got access to the same federal spending intelligence that winning contractors use to find their next contract.

But here's the thing: most people sign up for tools like this and never actually use them.

Don't be most people.

**Your First Mission (takes 60 seconds):**

1. Go to [Opportunity Hunter](https://tools.govcongiants.org/opportunity-hunter)
2. Enter your primary NAICS code
3. Select your set-aside type (or "All" if you're not sure)
4. Hit search

That's it. In under a minute, you'll see exactly which federal agencies are spending money on what you sell.

The agencies you discover today could become your biggest customers next year.

Go run your first search now: [Start Searching →](https://tools.govcongiants.org/opportunity-hunter)

To your GovCon success,
The GovCon Giants Team

P.S. Found some interesting agencies? Reply to this email and tell me what you discovered. I read every response.

### Email 2: The Agency Selection Mistake
**Subject:** The #1 mistake new contractors make (and how to avoid it)
**Send:** Day 2

Hi {{first_name}},

Yesterday I gave you access to Opportunity Hunter. Did you run your first search?

If you did, you probably saw a list of agencies spending money in your NAICS code. Great.

But here's where most contractors go wrong:

**They chase EVERY agency on the list.**

Big mistake.

Here's why: not every agency that spends money in your space is a good fit for YOUR business. Some agencies:
- Have procurement processes that take 18+ months
- Prefer large businesses despite set-aside requirements
- Are notoriously difficult to work with
- Have budgets getting cut next fiscal year

**What winning contractors do instead:**

They focus on 3-5 agencies maximum. They learn everything about those agencies. They build relationships. They position themselves as the obvious choice.

**Today's mission:** Go back to your Opportunity Hunter results and pick your TOP 3 agencies based on:
- Highest spending in your NAICS
- Set-aside contracts that match your certifications
- Agencies you've heard of or have some connection to

Write down those 3 agencies. These are your primary targets for the next 6 months.

[Review Your Search Results →](https://tools.govcongiants.org/opportunity-hunter)

Tomorrow, I'll show you how to research these agencies like a pro.

### Email 3: The Pain Point Discovery Method
**Subject:** What your target agencies are struggling with right now
**Send:** Day 3

Hi {{first_name}},

You've identified your top 3 target agencies. Now let's dig deeper.

**The secret to winning government contracts:**

It's not about having the lowest price.
It's not about having the most experience.
It's not even about who you know.

**It's about understanding what problems the agency needs solved.**

Every agency has "pain points" - challenges they're struggling with, mandates they need to meet, initiatives they're pushing forward.

When you understand these pain points, you can:
- Position your solution as the answer to THEIR problems
- Speak their language in proposals
- Build relationships by offering genuine value
- Stand out from competitors who just pitch features

**Here's how to find pain points:**

1. In Opportunity Hunter, click on any agency in your results
2. Look at the "Pain Points & Priorities" section
3. Note down 2-3 pain points relevant to your services

We've compiled pain points from Congressional testimony, GAO reports, agency strategic plans, and NDAA requirements. It's the kind of intel that used to take weeks to gather.

### Email 4: The OSBP Connection Strategy
**Subject:** The person at every agency who WANTS to help you win
**Send:** Day 4

Hi {{first_name}},

There's someone at every federal agency whose literal job is to help small businesses like yours win contracts.

They're called the **Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU)** or **Small Business Specialist**.

And here's what most contractors don't realize:

**These people have GOALS to meet.**

Every agency has small business contracting goals mandated by Congress. If they don't hit those goals, they get called out publicly. So these specialists are actively looking for capable small businesses.

They can:
- Tell you about upcoming opportunities before they're posted
- Introduce you to contracting officers
- Help you understand the agency's buying patterns
- Give you feedback on your capability statement

**How to find them:**

When you click on an agency in Opportunity Hunter, look for the OSBP (Office of Small Business Programs) contact information.

Then reach out with a simple email:

---
*Subject: Introduction - [Your Company] - [Your NAICS Code]*

*Hi [Name],*

*I'm [Your Name] with [Company], a [set-aside type] business specializing in [what you do].*

*I noticed [Agency] has been awarding contracts in NAICS [code] and wanted to introduce myself. We've successfully delivered [brief credential] and are looking to support [Agency's] mission.*

*Would you have 15 minutes for a brief call to learn about your agency's upcoming needs?*

*Best regards,*
*[Your Name]*

Simple, professional, to the point.

### Email 5: Introduction to Federal Market Assassin (Soft Sell)
**Subject:** What if you could see everything about an agency's buying patterns?
**Send:** Day 5

Hi {{first_name}},

This week you've learned how to:
✅ Find agencies spending in your NAICS
✅ Select your top 3 targets
✅ Discover their pain points
✅ Connect with small business specialists

That's more than 90% of contractors ever do. Seriously.

But I want to let you in on something...

**Opportunity Hunter is just the tip of the iceberg.**

It shows you WHICH agencies to target. But it doesn't tell you:

- Who are the prime contractors you should team with?
- What BPAs, IDIQs, and GWACs can you get on?
- Which 8(a) tribal businesses need partners?
- What similar contracts have been awarded (so you can price competitively)?
- What's the agency spending by fiscal quarter?

**That's what Federal Market Assassin does.**

It takes your 5 core inputs (NAICS, set-aside, location, etc.) and generates 8 comprehensive reports:

1. **Agency Spending Analytics** - Where the money flows
2. **Government Buyers** - Who's buying what you sell
3. **OSBP Contacts** - Small business office contacts
4. **Agency Pain Points** - What problems they need solved
5. **Subcontracting Opportunities** - Prime contractors to team with
6. **IDV Contracts** - BPAs, IDIQs, GWACs to pursue
7. **Similar Awards** - Past contracts for competitive intel
8. **Tribal Contracting** - 8(a) tribal partnership opportunities

It's the difference between knowing where to fish... and having a complete map of the ocean with fish locations, feeding times, and the best bait to use.

No pressure - Opportunity Hunter is yours forever, free. But when you're ready to go deeper, Market Assassin is there.

### Email 6: Case Study - From Search to Contract
**Subject:** How Marcus went from 0 to $1.2M in government contracts
**Send:** Day 6

Hi {{first_name}},

Let me tell you about Marcus.

Marcus ran an IT services company. Did great work. Had solid past performance in the private sector. But government contracting? He had no idea where to start.

He'd spent months:
- Randomly responding to SAM.gov postings (0 wins)
- Attending networking events (lots of business cards, no contracts)
- Sending capability statements into the void (no responses)

Then he tried something different.

**Week 1:** Used Opportunity Hunter to find agencies spending in NAICS 541512 (IT consulting). Found that the Department of Agriculture had spent $47M in his space last year.

**Week 2:** Clicked into USDA in the tool, discovered their pain points: aging IT infrastructure, cybersecurity mandates, and workforce modernization needs. Exactly what his company did.

**Week 3:** Found the OSBP contact, sent a simple introduction email. Got a meeting scheduled for the following week.

**Week 4:** In that meeting, learned about an upcoming $400K task order on an existing IDIQ. The specialist made an introduction to the contracting officer.

**3 months later:** Won the contract. $380K initial value.

**6 months later:** Task order extended. Total value: $1.2M.

The difference wasn't luck. It was strategy.

Marcus focused. He did the research. He understood the agency's problems. He positioned himself as the solution.

**You have the same tools Marcus used.** The question is: will you use them?

### Email 7: The Weekly BD Routine
**Subject:** The 2-hour weekly routine that wins contracts
**Send:** Day 7

Hi {{first_name}},

Week 1 is complete. You've got the foundation. Now let's talk about consistency.

Winning government contracts isn't about big bursts of effort. It's about steady, focused action over time.

Here's the **2-hour weekly routine** that successful contractors follow:

---

**MONDAY (30 min): Market Scan**
- Check SAM.gov for new opportunities in your NAICS
- Review your target agencies for any news/announcements
- Update your opportunity tracker

**WEDNESDAY (45 min): Relationship Building**
- Send one outreach email to an OSBP specialist
- Follow up on any pending conversations
- Connect with one new person on LinkedIn

**FRIDAY (45 min): Research & Learning**
- Deep dive into one target agency (pain points, org structure, key contacts)
- Read one article about your agency's mission area
- Update your capability statement if needed

---

**That's it.** 2 hours a week. Consistent effort beats sporadic hustle every time.

**Your mission this week:**

Block out these three time slots in your calendar right now. Treat them like client meetings - non-negotiable.

Then use Opportunity Hunter to fuel your research:
[Access Opportunity Hunter →](https://tools.govcongiants.org/opportunity-hunter)

Next week, we'll dive into specific tactics for each of your target agencies.

Have a great weekend,
The GovCon Giants Team

P.S. If 2 hours feels like a lot, remember: one $500K contract pays for years of BD effort. The ROI on government contracting is unlike anything in the private sector.

## WEEK 2: Deep Dive Tactics (Mon/Wed/Fri)

### Email 8: Set-Aside Strategy Deep Dive
**Subject:** Are you leaving money on the table with your set-asides?
**Send:** Week 2, Monday

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: what set-aside certifications do you have?

- 8(a)?
- HUBZone?
- SDVOSB?
- WOSB/EDWOSB?
- Small Disadvantaged Business?

If you answered "none" or "just small business," you might be competing in the hardest lane possible.

Here's the reality:

**Set-aside contracts have LESS competition.** Sometimes as few as 3-5 bidders compared to 20+ on full and open competitions.

**The math:**
- Full & open competition: 5% win rate (if you're lucky)
- Set-aside competition: 20-33% win rate

Same amount of work to submit a proposal. 4-6x better odds of winning.

**If you don't have certifications:**

1. Check if you qualify (many businesses do and don't realize it)
2. HUBZone is based on location - check if your office is in a HUBZone
3. WOSB just requires 51% woman ownership and control
4. SDVOSB requires service-disabled veteran ownership

**If you DO have certifications:**

Make sure you're filtering for them in Opportunity Hunter. Don't compete full and open when you don't have to.

### Email 9: The Teaming Advantage
**Subject:** Why going solo is killing your win rate
**Send:** Week 2, Wednesday

Hi {{first_name}},

Let me share something that might change how you think about government contracting:

**You don't have to win contracts alone.**

In fact, most successful small businesses win their first contracts as subcontractors to larger primes.

Here's why teaming works:

1. **Lower barrier to entry** - You don't need past performance on your own
2. **Built-in mentor** - Learn how the prime does things
3. **Steady revenue** - Cash flow while you build your direct contracting capability
4. **Relationship building** - Primes remember good subs when opportunities arise

**How to find teaming partners:**

Federal Market Assassin has a dedicated "Subcontracting Opportunities" report that shows you:
- Prime contractors in your space
- Their small business liaison officers (SBLOs)
- Contact information
- Which agencies they work with
- Whether they have subcontracting plans

It's the fastest way to find primes who need partners like you.

[See Prime Contractors in Your Space →](https://tools.govcongiants.org/federal-market-assassin)

**No Market Assassin yet?** Here's a manual approach:

1. Go to USAspending.gov
2. Search contracts in your NAICS
3. Find the top prime contractors
4. Google "[Company Name] small business liaison" or check their website

More work, but doable.

The key is this: don't try to go it alone. The government contracting world rewards collaboration.

### Email 10: IDV Contracts Explained
**Subject:** BPAs, IDIQs, GWACs - what are they and why you need them
**Send:** Week 2, Friday

Hi {{first_name}},

If you've been in GovCon for more than a week, you've heard terms like:
- BPA (Blanket Purchase Agreement)
- IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity)
- GWAC (Government-Wide Acquisition Contract)

Sounds complicated. It's actually simple.

**Think of them like a "menu" the government orders from.**

Instead of running a full competition every time they need something, agencies set up these contract vehicles with pre-qualified vendors. Then when they need something, they just order from the "menu."

**Why this matters to you:**

If you're on the menu, you get opportunities WITHOUT competing against everyone.

If you're NOT on the menu, you're invisible for those orders.

**The numbers:**

Over $150 BILLION in federal contracts flow through IDV vehicles annually. More than a third of all contract spending.

**How to get on these vehicles:**

1. **Find vehicles in your space** - Federal Market Assassin's IDV Contracts report shows you which vehicles are used for your NAICS codes
2. **Check if they're open** - Some vehicles have on-ramps or are periodically re-competed
3. **Apply when open** - Getting on a GSA Schedule or agency-specific IDIQ

4. **Subcontract to primes on the vehicle** - If you can't get on directly, team with someone who is

[See IDV Contracts in Your Market →](https://tools.govcongiants.org/federal-market-assassin)

This is intermediate-level stuff. If it feels overwhelming, just bookmark this email and come back to it when you've won your first direct contract.

## WEEK 3: Overcoming Objections (Mon/Wed/Fri)

### Email 11: "I don't have past performance"
**Subject:** How to win contracts without government experience
**Send:** Week 3, Monday

Hi {{first_name}},

The #1 objection I hear from new contractors:

*"But I don't have any government past performance!"*

I get it. It feels like a Catch-22. You need past performance to win contracts, but you need contracts to get past performance.

Here's the truth: **you probably have more relevant experience than you think.**

**What counts as past performance:**

✅ Private sector work (especially with large enterprises)
✅ State and local government contracts
✅ Subcontracts under federal primes
✅ Work for quasi-governmental organizations
✅ Even relevant volunteer/pro-bono work

**How to position non-federal experience:**

In your capability statement and proposals, focus on:
- The PROBLEM you solved (similar to federal agency problems)
- The SCOPE (show you can handle the contract size)
- The RESULTS (quantified outcomes)
- The RELEVANCE (draw clear parallels to the federal requirement)

**Quick wins to build past performance:**

1. **Subcontract** - Partner with primes who need your capabilities
2. **Micro-purchases** - Contracts under $10K have minimal requirements
3. **8(a) sole source** - If you're 8(a), agencies can sole source up to $4.5M
4. **Simplified acquisitions** - Contracts $10K-$250K have easier requirements

The path exists. You just have to start walking it.

### Email 12: "Government contracts take too long"
**Subject:** The truth about government contracting timelines
**Send:** Week 3, Wednesday

Hi {{first_name}},

*"Government contracts take forever to award."*

Yes and no. Let me explain.

**The myth:** All government contracts take 12-18 months from opportunity to award.

**The reality:** It depends on the acquisition method.

**Fast (days to weeks):**
- Credit card purchases (under $10K)
- BPA/IDIQ task orders
- Simplified acquisitions (under $250K)
- 8(a) sole source awards

**Medium (1-3 months):**
- Small business set-asides
- Simplified acquisitions over $100K
- GSA Schedule orders

**Slow (6-18 months):**
- Full and open competition over $250K
- New IDIQ/GWAC on-ramps
- Major system acquisitions

**The strategy:**

If you need revenue quickly, focus on:
1. Subcontracting (primes pay faster than the government)
2. Simplified acquisitions and micro-purchases
3. Getting on existing contract vehicles (GSA, agency BPAs)
4. 8(a) sole source if you have the certification

If you can wait for bigger wins, pursue the larger set-aside competitions while your quick wins provide cash flow.

**The key insight:**

Your BD pipeline should have a mix of short-term and long-term opportunities. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

## WEEK 4: Value & Urgency (Mon/Wed/Fri)

### Email 14: Fiscal Year End Opportunity
**Subject:** Q4 spending surge - are you positioned?
**Send:** Week 4, Monday

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick fiscal calendar lesson:

The federal government's fiscal year ends September 30th. And every year, the same thing happens:

**Agencies rush to spend their remaining budget in Q4 (July-September).**

Why? Because unspent money often gets reallocated. Program managers who don't spend their budget look like they don't need it.

**The numbers:**

- 30-35% of all federal contract dollars are spent in Q4
- September alone accounts for ~16% of annual spending
- Small business set-aside spending spikes as agencies try to meet goals

**What this means for you:**

If you're positioned with an agency by summer, you're in the running for year-end spending. If you're still trying to get introduced in August, you've missed the window.

**The timeline:**

- NOW: Build relationships, get on agency radar
- Q2 (Jan-Mar): Position for upcoming requirements
- Q3 (Apr-Jun): Be in active conversations about FY needs
- Q4 (Jul-Sep): Execute, win, deliver

Start now. Position yourself for the Q4 surge.

### Email 15: The Real Cost of DIY Research
**Subject:** 40 hours vs. 40 minutes
**Send:** Week 4, Wednesday

Hi {{first_name}},

Let me ask you something:

How much is your time worth?

A contractor I talked to last week spent 40+ hours manually researching his target agencies. He:
- Pulled spending data from USAspending.gov
- Searched for OSBP contacts on agency websites
- Read GAO reports for pain points
- Compiled lists of prime contractors
- Cross-referenced everything in spreadsheets

40 hours. A full work week.

**Here's the thing:** That research is valuable. It WILL help him win contracts.

But another contractor with the same inputs got the same intelligence in about 40 minutes using Federal Market Assassin.

**40 hours vs. 40 minutes.**

Same output. Different time investment.

**The math:**

If your billable rate is $150/hour, that 40 hours of research costs you $6,000 in opportunity cost.

Federal Market Assassin Standard is $297. Premium is $497.

One generates 4 comprehensive reports. The other generates all 8.

I'm not saying DIY doesn't work. It does. You can absolutely do this research manually with Opportunity Hunter and other free tools.

But at some point, time becomes more valuable than money.

Only you know when you've hit that point.

### Email 16: Success Story - From Skeptic to Believer
**Subject:** "I thought government contracting was for big companies"
**Send:** Week 4, Friday

Hi {{first_name}},

Sarah ran a 4-person cybersecurity consulting firm.

Her belief: *"Government contracts are for big defense contractors, not small shops like mine."*

She signed up for Opportunity Hunter to "see what the fuss was about."

What she found surprised her:

**$2.7 billion** in small business set-aside spending in her NAICS code (541519 - Computer Related Services) in the past year.

*"Wait... $2.7 BILLION going to small businesses? In my space?"*

She clicked deeper. Found that the Department of Veterans Affairs alone had spent $340M in set-asides. And they had specific pain points around legacy system modernization - exactly what her team specialized in.

She reached out to the VA's OSBP. Got a meeting. Three months later, she won a $180K task order to assess a legacy system migration.

That one contract was more revenue than her entire previous year.

**The lesson:**

The opportunity is there. The set-aside money exists. Agencies WANT to work with small businesses.

But you have to show up. You have to do the research. You have to make the outreach.

Sarah used free tools to get started. When she got serious, she invested in Market Assassin to accelerate her pipeline development.

Both paths work. One is just faster.

Where are you on your journey?

## WEEKS 5-6: Advanced Tactics (Tuesday/Thursday)

### Email 17: Understanding Agency Buying Cycles
**Subject:** When agencies actually have money to spend
**Send:** Week 5, Tuesday

Hi {{first_name}},

Not all times are equal for business development.

Here's the federal buying cycle:

**October-December (Q1):**
- New fiscal year starts
- New budgets being allocated
- Good time for introductions and relationship building
- Limited new contract awards (budget still being distributed)

**January-March (Q2):**
- Budgets are set
- Requirements being defined
- Solicitations starting to drop
- PRIME TIME for BD meetings and positioning

**April-June (Q3):**
- Major contracting activity
- Most solicitations released
- Agencies planning for year-end spending
- Good time to be in active pursuit of opportunities

**July-September (Q4):**
- Year-end spending surge
- Quick-turn requirements
- Agencies racing to obligate funds
- Less time for new relationships, more transactional

**What this means for you:**

Your BD activities should align with these cycles:
- Q1: Plant seeds, build relationships
- Q2: Position for requirements
- Q3: Actively pursue opportunities
- Q4: Execute and capture quick wins

Right now, where are you in this cycle? What should you be doing?

### Email 18: The Capability Statement That Gets Meetings
**Subject:** Your capability statement is probably wrong (here's how to fix it)
**Send:** Week 5, Thursday

Hi {{first_name}},

Your capability statement is your one-page business card for government contracting.

Most capability statements are terrible. They read like this:

*"XYZ Corporation is a full-service provider of innovative solutions leveraging best-in-class methodologies to deliver synergistic outcomes..."*

Nobody knows what that means. Nobody cares.

**Here's what works:**

**Section 1: What You Do (2 sentences max)**
"We help [type of agency] solve [specific problem] through [your approach]. Our clients save [specific benefit]."

**Section 2: Core Capabilities (bullet points)**
- Capability 1 (with specific outcome)
- Capability 2 (with specific outcome)
- Capability 3 (with specific outcome)

**Section 3: Past Performance (3 projects)**
- Client, Scope, Result
- Client, Scope, Result
- Client, Scope, Result

**Section 4: Company Data**
- DUNS/UEI, CAGE, NAICS codes
- Set-aside certifications
- Contract vehicles

**Section 5: Contact**
- Key contact with direct line

That's it. One page. Scannable. Clear.

**Pro tip:** Create agency-specific versions highlighting relevant pain points and past performance. Federal Market Assassin's pain point data helps you customize effectively.

### Email 19: Following Up Without Being Annoying
**Subject:** The follow-up sequence that gets responses
**Send:** Week 6, Tuesday

Hi {{first_name}},

Sent an email to an OSBP specialist and heard nothing back?

Don't give up. Government people are BUSY. No response usually means they haven't gotten to it, not that they're ignoring you.

**The follow-up sequence that works:**

**Day 1:** Initial outreach email

**Day 7:** Gentle follow-up
*"Hi [Name], wanted to follow up on my note from last week. I'd love to learn more about [Agency's] small business programs. Would you have 15 minutes this week or next?"*

**Day 21:** Value-add follow-up
*"Hi [Name], I came across [relevant article/report about their agency] and thought of our conversation. I'd still love to connect when you have time. Let me know if there's a better way to reach you."*

**Day 45:** Last attempt
*"Hi [Name], I've reached out a few times without connecting. I don't want to be a pest, so this will be my last email. If there's ever an opportunity to discuss how [Company] might support [Agency], I'm here. Wishing you well."*

**Key principles:**
- Always be respectful of their time
- Provide value, don't just ask
- Space your follow-ups appropriately
- Know when to move on

Remember: you're trying to build a relationship, not make a sale. Act accordingly.

### Email 20: Tribal Contracting Explained
**Subject:** The 8(a) tribal advantage (and how you can benefit)
**Send:** Week 6, Thursday

Hi {{first_name}},

Here's something most contractors don't know about:

**8(a) Tribal Entities** can receive sole-source contracts with NO CAP on value.

Regular 8(a) companies: sole source limited to $4.5M (services) or $7M (manufacturing)
8(a) Tribal entities: UNLIMITED sole source

Some of these tribes have won contracts worth hundreds of millions.

**Why this matters to you (even if you're not tribal):**

These tribal enterprises need partners. They need:
- Technical expertise they don't have in-house
- Subcontractors to execute the work
- Mentor-protégé relationships
- Joint venture partners

**How to find tribal partners:**

Federal Market Assassin includes a Tribal Contracting report that shows:
- Tribal 8(a) enterprises in your industry
- Their capabilities and certifications
- Contact information
- Agencies they work with

If you can find a tribal entity that needs your expertise, you can access opportunities that would otherwise be closed to you.

This is advanced strategy - don't worry about it until you've mastered the basics. But file it away for when you're ready.

## WEEKS 7-8: Closing & Next Steps (Tuesday/Thursday)

### Email 21: Your Progress Check
**Subject:** It's been 6 weeks - where are you now?
**Send:** Week 7, Tuesday

Hi {{first_name}},

Six weeks ago, you signed up for Opportunity Hunter.

Let's do a quick check-in:

**Where should you be by now:**
□ Completed searches in Opportunity Hunter
□ Identified 3-5 target agencies
□ Reviewed pain points for each agency
□ Found OSBP contacts
□ Sent at least 2-3 outreach emails
□ Had at least one conversation with an agency rep

**If you've done this:** Congratulations! You're ahead of 95% of people who say they want government contracts. Keep going.

**If you haven't:** No judgment. Life gets busy. But today is a new day.

**Your mission (if you haven't started yet):**

Spend 30 minutes today on ONE thing:

1. Go to Opportunity Hunter
2. Run a search with your NAICS code
3. Click on ONE agency that looks interesting
4. Note their OSBP contact

That's it. 30 minutes. One step forward.

### Email 22: The Tools That Separate Winners from Dreamers
**Subject:** The difference between hoping and doing
**Send:** Week 7, Thursday

Hi {{first_name}},

Harsh truth time:

**Most people who say they want government contracts will never win one.**

Not because it's impossible.
Not because they're not qualified.
Not because the system is rigged.

**Because they never take consistent action.**

They think about it. They read about it. They attend webinars about it.

But they don't:
- Research specific agencies
- Make outreach calls
- Submit capability statements
- Pursue actual opportunities

**The winners are different.**

They have:
1. Clear targets (specific agencies, not "the government")
2. Research to back their approach (spending data, pain points)
3. A consistent BD routine (not sporadic effort)
4. Patience (6-18 month sales cycles are normal)

**Where do you want to be?**

You have Opportunity Hunter. It's free forever. Use it.

If you want to accelerate, Federal Market Assassin is there:
- Standard ($297): 4 core reports, 30 reports/month
- Premium ($497): All 8 reports, unlimited

Both give you the intelligence. Neither does the work for you.

The choice is yours. The tools are ready.

### Email 26: Post-Promo Value
**Subject:** Even without the discount, here's why Market Assassin pays for itself
**Send:** Week 8, Friday

Hi {{first_name}},

The discount ended. If you grabbed it, awesome - welcome aboard!

If you didn't, here's something to consider:

**The ROI math:**

Average small business federal contract: $150,000+
Cost of Federal Market Assassin Premium: $497

That's a 300x return on investment if you win ONE contract.

Even if Market Assassin only increases your win probability by 1%, the math works out overwhelmingly in your favor.

But more realistically:
- You save 30-40 hours of research time
- You get intel that most competitors don't have
- You find teaming partners you'd never discover manually
- You understand agency pain points at a deeper level

All of that compounds into better positioning, stronger proposals, and higher win rates.

The discount is gone, but the value is the same.
