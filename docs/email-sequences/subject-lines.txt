2. Use {{first_name}} sparingly (1-2x per week max)
3. Lowercase feels personal, Title Case feels promotional
4. Questions drive curiosity
5. Numbers add specificity ($759B, 34 contracts, 60 seconds)
6. Avoid spam triggers: FREE, URGENT, ACT NOW, !!!
7. Preview text matters - first line of email shows in inbox

A/B TEST TIPS
=============
- Test Primary vs Alt A first
- Run for 2-4 hours before picking winner
- Track opens AND clicks (opens alone can mislead)
- Winning patterns: personalization, curiosity gaps, specific numbers
