# The 5 Types of Info Product Buyers

Understanding who actually opens wallets. Once you understand this, you'll print forever while everyone else fights over scraps.

## 1. Rock Bottom Buyer

**Psychology:** Just went through something painful. Breakup. Got fired. Health scare. Public humiliation. Their identity shattered and they're desperate to rebuild into someone new.

**What they're buying:** Not information. They're buying a new identity to escape the old one.

**Will buy:**
- Fitness
- Dating
- Money
- Spirituality

Doesn't matter the topic - they need transformation.

**Where to find them:**
- Comment sections at 2am
- Reddit posts about "starting over"
- Tweets/posts about life falling apart
- Forums about major life changes

**Why they convert:** They NEED to take action to feel like they're fixing themselves. Conversion rate is high because action = self-repair.

## 2. Almost There Buyer

**Psychology:** Already tried everything. Courses. Coaches. Books. YouTube rabbit holes. Not a beginner. Spent thousands already. Knows the basics.

**What they're buying:** The "missing piece" that finally clicks.

**Why they're valuable:** They've PROVEN they spend money. Just need to believe you have what they haven't tried yet.

**Where to find them:**
- Asking specific questions in communities
- "Has anyone tried X method?"
- "What's actually working in 2025?"
- Advanced discussions, not beginner questions

**How to convert:** Position your offer as "what the gurus don't teach" and they purchase same day.

## 3. Identity Buyer

**Psychology:** Doesn't actually want results. Wants to FEEL like the type of person who buys this type of thing.

**Examples:**
- Buying a trading course = "I'm a trader now"
- Buying a fitness program = "I'm an athlete"
- Joining a mastermind = "I'm an entrepreneur"

**Behavior:** Buys repeatedly and never opens the content. They just want the label.

**Why communities print hard:** They're paying for the identity of being "in the room."

**Where to find them:**
- Flexing purchases in comments
- Posting screenshots of courses
- Talking about what they're "working on"
- Showing off memberships and access

**Retention:** Insane retention because leaving = giving up the identity.

## 4. Escape Buyer

**Psychology:** Hates their current life. Job. City. Relationship. Whatever. No specific goal - just wants OUT.

**What converts:**
- Remote work
- Passive income
- Location independence
- "Fire your boss"
- Freedom messaging

**What they're buying:** Not a business model. A fantasy of a different life.

**Where to find them:**
- Posting about hating Mondays
- Commenting "this is the dream" on lifestyle content
- Asking "how do I start" on every money post
- Daydreaming in comment sections

**How to sell:** Sell the destination, not the vehicle. They'll pay premium for anything that feels like a way out.

## 5. Revenge Buyer

**Psychology:** Wants to prove someone wrong. Ex. Parents. Old boss. That one person from high school. Not motivated by success - motivated by making someone feel stupid for doubting them.

**Behavior:** Aggressive. Works harder than anyone because it's personal.

**Why they pay more:** The purchase itself is part of the revenge. "I invested in myself while you stayed average."

**Where to find them:**
- Posting about people who wronged them
- "Can't wait to show them" type content
- Success as spite narratives
- Underdog stories

**How to sell:** Lean into the revenge angle and they throw money at you.

## The Key Insight

**The mistake:** Trying to sell to "everyone."

Everyone doesn't buy. Only people in these 5 psychological states buy.

**Stop:** Writing generic copy about "results" and "value"

**Start:** Writing copy that makes someone in crisis feel like you're reading their mind

**Fish where people are already reaching for wallets.**
