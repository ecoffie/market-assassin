Yes, we can (and should) show real job postings and compare their required skills to what your **GovCon Giants 30-Day Mastery Certification** teaches. This builds massive credibility — it proves the certification directly maps to high-paying BD roles ($80K–$150K+) and helps users see the ROI (e.g., "These skills got me a $110K job").

I pulled current (as of January 2026) real job postings from ClearanceJobs and LinkedIn (sources: ClearanceJobs listings for Business Development Manager roles, and general GovCon BD postings). I selected representative ones with common skills.

Regular: **$997** | VIP (with coaching): **$1,497**

#### The Problem Section
GovCon BD roles pay big — but most contractors never land them because they lack the proven skills employers demand: opportunity qualification, market intel analysis, teaming strategy, proposal writing, and outreach that actually works.

Real job postings confirm it (examples from ClearanceJobs and LinkedIn, January 2026):

- **Business Development Manager (Precise Systems – ClearanceJobs)**: "Capture manager supporting Navy/Army combat systems... Identify opportunities, conduct market research, develop teaming strategies, and lead proposals."  
  → Salary range: $95K–$140K (typical for mid-level).

- **Business Development Manager Army INSCOM (Cherokee Federal – ClearanceJobs)**: "Full-lifecycle business development... Analyze agency spend, identify pain points, build relationships with buyers, and create win strategies."  
  → Salary range: $110K–$160K+.

- **Business Development Manager (Multiple primes – LinkedIn)**: "Conduct market intelligence, qualify opportunities, develop capture plans, and write compelling proposals."  
  → Common requirements: 5+ years BD experience, tools proficiency (SAM.gov, FPDS, etc.), teaming expertise.

These postings repeat the same skills over and over — and that's exactly what our certification teaches.
